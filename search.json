    "text": "The NASCAR season is in full swing, and it is time to evaluate which drivers are performing the best. The schedule sees drivers take on more than just left turns with six road courses and one street course in downtown Chicago. The other tracks range from less than one mile to over 2.5 miles in length, with average speeds ranging from 110 to over 200 miles per hour. The schedule so far has included two drafting tracks (Daytona and Atlanta), one road course (Circuit of The Americas or COTA), two intermediate tracks (Las Vegas and Homestead-Miami), and two short tracks (Phoenix and Martinsville). This wide range of tracks offers wildly distinctive styles and results.\nThrough the first seven races of the season, there have been five different winners, with only one repeat winner: Christopher Bell in the No. 20 Toyota, who earned three consecutive wins in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th races of the year. William Byron in the No. 24 Chevrolet opened the year with a win at Daytona, marking his second consecutive year with a win there. Bell went on to win at Atlanta, COTA, and Phoenix. Josh Berry in the No. 21 Ford won at Las Vegas, Kyle Larson in the No. 5 Chevrolet won at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and Denny Hamlin in the No. 11 Toyota won at Martinsville.\nWhile leading laps is often crucial to winning races, it doesn’t always guarantee victory. Denny Hamlin has led almost 300 laps but has only won one race so far. Another way to evaluate the top drivers is by their respective manufacturer.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nnascar2025&lt;-read_csv(\"2025 NASCAR Season 7 Races - github(Sheet1).csv\")\n\nnascar2025 &lt;- nascar2025 |&gt; \n  clean_names() |&gt; \n  remove_empty(which = c(\"rows\", \"cols\"))\n\nEncoding(nascar2025$driver) &lt;- \"latin1\"\nnascar2025$driver &lt;- iconv(nascar2025$driver, \"latin1\", \"ASCII\", sub=\"\")\n\nlapleaders &lt;- nascar2025 |&gt;\n  group_by(driver) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_laps_led = sum(led)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_laps_led))\n\ntop10lapleaders &lt;- lapleaders |&gt; \n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\ndh &lt;- top10lapleaders |&gt; filter(grepl(\"Denny Hamlin\", driver) == TRUE)\njl &lt;- top10lapleaders |&gt; filter(grepl(\"Joey Logano\", driver) == TRUE)\nwb &lt;- top10lapleaders |&gt; filter(grepl(\"William Byron\", driver) == TRUE)\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data = top10lapleaders, aes(x=reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill = \"gray\")+\n  geom_bar(data=dh, aes(x = reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill =\"red\")+\n  geom_bar(data=jl, aes(x = reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill=\"blue\")+\n  geom_bar(data=wb, aes(x = reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill= \"gold\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Driver\", \n    y=\"Total Laps Led\", \n    title=\"Top 10 Lap Leaders\", \n    subtitle=\"Red is Toyota.

Leading laps also do not guarantee a driver will finish well. The top ten in laps led may not be the top ten in average finishes this year.\n\n\nCode\navgfinishes&lt;-nascar2025|&gt; \n  group_by(driver)|&gt;\n  arrange(driver, race)|&gt;\n  mutate(avgfinishes = cummean(position))|&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\ntop10avgfinishers &lt;-avgfinishes|&gt;\n  filter(race == 7)|&gt;\n  arrange(avgfinishes)|&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\ntop10avgfinishers &lt;- top10avgfinishers|&gt; top_n(10, wt=race) |&gt;\n  select(number, driver, car, avgfinishes)\n\ntop10avgfinishers|&gt; \ngt()|&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    number = \"Number\",\n    driver = \"Driver\",\n    car = \"Manufacturer\",\n    avgfinishes = \"Average Finish\"\n    )|&gt;\n    tab_header(\n    title = \"What driver has the best average finish?\",\n    subtitle = \"Red is the top Toyota driver, blue is the top Ford driver, gold is the top Chevy driver.\"\n  )|&gt;  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt; tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Blake Mace  |  **Source:** Racing Reference\")\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   )|&gt;  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = number == \"20\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = number == \"17\")\n  )|&gt;tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = number == \"5\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat driver has the best average finish?\n\n\nRed is the top Toyota driver, blue is the top Ford driver, gold is the top Chevy driver.\n\n\nNumber\nDriver\nManufacturer\nAverage Finish\n\n\n\n\n5\nKyle Larson\nChevrolet\n10.42857\n\n\n24\nWilliam Byron\nChevrolet\n10.57143\n\n\n20\nChristopher Bell\nToyota\n11.00000\n\n\n9\nChase Elliott\nChevrolet\n11.57143\n\n\n48\nAlex Bowman\nChevrolet\n12.00000\n\n\n11\nDenny Hamlin\nToyota\n12.00000\n\n\n45\nTyler Reddick\nToyota\n12.85714\n\n\n17\nChris Buescher\nFord\n13.57143\n\n\n19\nChase Briscoe\nToyota\n14.85714\n\n\n71\nMichael McDowell\nChevrolet\n15.71429\n\n\n\nBy: Blake Mace | Source: Racing Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the average finish, the top drivers from each manufacturer also shift. Now, considering the results of those same top ten drivers on a chart reveals that even a driver like Bell, who has won 3 out of 7 races this season, does not have the best average finish.\n\n\nCode\ndrivers &lt;- c(\"Kyle Larson\", \"William Byron\", \"Christopher Bell\", \"Chase Elliott\", \"Alex Bowman\", \"Denny Hamlin\", \"Tyler Reddick\", \"Chris Buescher\", \"Chase Briscoe\", \"Michael McDowell\")\ntop10driverfinishes &lt;- nascar2025|&gt;\n  filter(driver %in% drivers)|&gt;\n  select(position, number, driver, race)\n\nggplot()+ geom_bump(data=top10driverfinishes, aes(x=race, y=position, color=driver))+\ngeom_point(data=top10driverfinishes, aes(x=race, y=position, color=driver), size = 4)+\nscale_color_manual(values = c(\"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"blue\", \"red\", \"grey\", \"gold\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Top 10 average finishers and their finishing positions\", \n    subtitle=\"Using the top 10 average finishers to see their finishing positions\",\n    caption=\"Source: Racing Reference | By Blake Mace\",\n    y= \"Finishing Position\", \n    x= \"Race\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n    ) |&gt;\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Bell, Alex Bowman, William Byron, Denny Hamlin, and Kyle Larson all appear in the two measured statistics. All these drivers, except Alex Bowman, have won a race. With only seven out of 36 races completed, the season still has a long way to go, but these statistics highlight which drivers have started the season with much needed momentum."
