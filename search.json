    "title": "Who are the best NASCAR drivers at seasons end in the next-gen era?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The NASCAR season is 36 races long. Drivers experience different momentum swings from crashing out consistently, having a winning streak, having a top ten finish streak and more. The final five races of the season provide an interesting stretch of data that will be dubbed “crunch time.”\nIn 2022 NASCAR introduced the next-gen car. This car completely changed how the cars looked and raced. Since then, the top drivers have changed, and a new era of drivers has emerged. Taking the final five races of every season since 2022 will provide the parameters needed to find which driver is the best during “crunch time.”\nManufacturers are further way to breakdown which driver is doing better in “crunch time.” Using the previously outlined standards William Byron (gold for Chevy) leads the way with an impressive average finish of 7.06. Joey Logano (blue for Ford) on back is where the average finish margin narrows. Christopher Bell (red for Toyota) sits fourth on this metric with an average finish of 10.20.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nnextgen&lt;-read_csv(\"NASCAR Next-Gen Stats Final 5 Races.csv\")\n\nnextgen &lt;- nextgen |&gt; \n  clean_names() |&gt; \n  remove_empty(which = c(\"rows\", \"cols\"))\n\nEncoding(nextgen$driver) &lt;- \"latin1\"\n\nnextgen$driver &lt;- iconv(nextgen$driver, \"latin1\", \"ASCII\", sub=\"\")\n\ndriverstats&lt;-nextgen|&gt;\n  group_by(driver)|&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Start = mean(start),\n    Finish = mean(position)\n  )\ntop10drivers &lt;- driverstats |&gt;\n  arrange(Finish) |&gt;  \n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\ntop10drivers|&gt; \ngt()|&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    driver = \"Driver\",\n    Start = \"Average Start\",\n    Finish = \"Average Finish\"\n    )|&gt;\n    tab_header(\n    title = \"William Byron has the best average in crunch time\",\n    subtitle = \"William Byron has the best Chevy average finish.

Since the inception of the next-gen car in 2022, Ford has been the only manufacturer to win a championship. Logano has won two championships in 2022 and 2024. Blaney won once in 2023. The unpredictability of NASCAR makes it hard to determine if “crunch time” matters. At least the champions appeared on all the measured statistics."

    "text": "The NASCAR season is in full swing, and it is time to evaluate which drivers are performing the best. The schedule sees drivers take on more than just left turns with six road courses and one street course in downtown Chicago. The other tracks range from less than one mile to over 2.5 miles in length, with average speeds ranging from 110 to over 200 miles per hour. The schedule so far has included two drafting tracks (Daytona and Atlanta), one road course (Circuit of The Americas or COTA), two intermediate tracks (Las Vegas and Homestead-Miami), and two short tracks (Phoenix and Martinsville). This wide range of tracks offers wildly distinctive styles and results.\nThrough the first seven races of the season, there have been five different winners, with only one repeat winner: Christopher Bell in the No. 20 Toyota, who earned three consecutive wins in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th races of the year. William Byron in the No. 24 Chevrolet opened the year with a win at Daytona, marking his second consecutive year with a win there. Bell went on to win at Atlanta, COTA, and Phoenix. Josh Berry in the No. 21 Ford won at Las Vegas, Kyle Larson in the No. 5 Chevrolet won at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and Denny Hamlin in the No. 11 Toyota won at Martinsville.\nWhile leading laps is often crucial to winning races, it doesn’t always guarantee victory. Denny Hamlin has led almost 300 laps but has only won one race so far. Another way to evaluate the top drivers is by their respective manufacturer.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nnascar2025&lt;-read_csv(\"2025 NASCAR Season 7 Races - github(Sheet1).csv\")\n\nnascar2025 &lt;- nascar2025 |&gt; \n  clean_names() |&gt; \n  remove_empty(which = c(\"rows\", \"cols\"))\n\nEncoding(nascar2025$driver) &lt;- \"latin1\"\nnascar2025$driver &lt;- iconv(nascar2025$driver, \"latin1\", \"ASCII\", sub=\"\")\n\nlapleaders &lt;- nascar2025 |&gt;\n  group_by(driver) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_laps_led = sum(led)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_laps_led))\n\ntop10lapleaders &lt;- lapleaders |&gt; \n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\ndh &lt;- top10lapleaders |&gt; filter(grepl(\"Denny Hamlin\", driver) == TRUE)\njl &lt;- top10lapleaders |&gt; filter(grepl(\"Joey Logano\", driver) == TRUE)\nwb &lt;- top10lapleaders |&gt; filter(grepl(\"William Byron\", driver) == TRUE)\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data = top10lapleaders, aes(x=reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill = \"gray\")+\n  geom_bar(data=dh, aes(x = reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill =\"red\")+\n  geom_bar(data=jl, aes(x = reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill=\"blue\")+\n  geom_bar(data=wb, aes(x = reorder(driver, total_laps_led), weight=total_laps_led), fill= \"gold\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Driver\", \n    y=\"Total Laps Led\", \n    title=\"Top 10 Lap Leaders\", \n    subtitle=\"Red is Toyota.

All these drivers, except Alex Bowman, have won a race. With only seven out of 36 races completed, the season still has a long way to go, but these statistics highlight which drivers have started the season with much needed momentum."
